[Brain, Minds and MAchines Summer Course](https://cbmm.mit.edu/summer-school)

In May 2014, the Center launched the first Brains, Minds, and Machines (BMM) summer course, held on the campus of the Marine Biological Laboratory 
in Woods Hole, MA. Annually, the course enrolls 30 graduate students and postdocs from around the world, and provides a “deep end” introduction to the problem of intelligence - 
how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines. Like CBMM itself, the philosophy of the course is that the synergistic
combination of neuroscience, cognitive science, mathematics, and computer science, will lead to the creation of much more robust and sophisticated algorithms implemented in 
intelligent machines and will accelerate the scientific investigation of how intelligent behavior emerges from neural activity in the brain. The BMM summer course includes 
tutorials on general theoretical foundations and computational methods used in intelligence research, with hands-on computer work, and introductions to empirical methods 
used in neuroscience and cognitive science to probe the function of neural circuits and emergent behavior. Through lectures by CBMM faculty, the course delves deeply into 
current research on intelligence, with emphasis on topics that reflect the scientific focus of the Center. Students pursue extended research projects supervised by course 
faculty and teaching assistants. The overall goal of the BMM summer course is to create a community of researchers in the science of intelligence who are equally knowledgeable 
in neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science. The content of the 2015 summer course is published on MIT OpenCourseWare (https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-9-003-brains-minds-and-machines-summer-course-summer-2015/). Additional lecture videos and supporting 
materials for tutorials on useful computational methods can be found on the 2018 Summer Course Resources page (https://cbmm.mit.edu/summer-school/2018/resources), 
the Machine Learning Day page (https://cbmm.mit.edu/summer-school/2018/machine-learning-day), and the Tutorials page (https://cbmm.mit.edu/learning-hub/tutorials) on
